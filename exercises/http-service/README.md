# HTTP Service

Create a component that has a button that when pressed uses a service to make an HTTP request to retrieve JSON from a RESTful API and formats and displays the result.

## Step 1

Using the `angular-cli` create a new project called `http-service` inside of the `training` folder.

## Step 2

Using the `angular-cli` create a new service called `http-client` in the `http-service` project.  Notice that `app.module.ts` was not updated to import or provide the new `http-client` service.

## Step 3

Update `app.module.ts` to import and provide the `http-client` service.
