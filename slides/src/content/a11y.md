<!-- .slide: id="a11y" -->
## What is Accessibility

- Accessibility is generally defined as giving people of all abilities opportunities to participate fully in everyday life.  This more recently includes use of digital technology.

- Accessibility can often be thought of as being complimentary to, or a subset of usability.  A feature on a site may be highly usable but inaccessible.  

  - For example, a button may be easy to find and click, but inaccessible via a keyboard

- Accessibilty is now law in many parts of the world including within Canada and the U.S.

- Accessiblity requirements for digital content / media are based on the international standards defined by the W3C.  
    - In 1999, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 1.0 were developed, updated to v2.0 in 2008
    - There are three levels of compliance that an organization can meet in  WCAG 2.0:  A, AA and AAA
    - Most compliance internationally, including within government, is against v2.0 AA

## P.O.U.R.

The key principles of accessibility specify that sites must be:

1. Perceivable - Content on a site must be perceivable with assistive devices to aid those who have difficulties using one or multiple senses
1. Operable - A site must provide several ways to operate it to be accessible.  Eg. use of a mouse AND a keyboard to navigate and operate all site controls
1. Understandable - A site must use simple terms to explain concepts and complex issues / content  
  - It must function in a way that your users understand, by avoiding unusual, unexpected or inconsistent functions
1. Robust - A site must meet several accessiblity standards and guidelines on any number of 3rd party user software and tools (i.e multiple browsers, operating systems, mobile devices)

## Implementing Accessibility - Starting with Design

Accessibility starts with design and includes accessibility testing throughout the product development life cycle.

Some of the Largest Identified Accessibility Barriers across Public Sites

1. Content and functionality that cannot be operated through a keyboard
1. Form fields that are not labelled properly
1. Images that donâ€™t have alternative text
1. Insufficient contrast between text and background
1. Reading order that is not in a meaningful sequence

Designers and developers can include several accessibility and design features to overcome challenges:

---
<!-- .slide: id="a11y" -->
## Accessible Design - Tabbing Order

- When developing sites accessibily, ensure that read / tabbing order is left to right, top to bottom so that sites 'read like a book'

<!-- .slide: id="a11y" -->
## Accessible Design - Font and Colour

- Fonts: Use sans serif fonts and set a base pixel measure at 1em = 16px (=12pt)
  - Alter the base depending on the device type: Desktop = 1.0em, Tablet = 1.1em, Smartphone=1.2em
- Colour:  Ensure foreground:background ratios are 4:5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text
- Images: Images must be alt tagged or have figures/numbers describing the image

<!-- .slide: id="a11y" -->
## Accessible Design - Tables
- Tables:  Do not use tables for layout, only data, and explicitly label columns and rows
<br><br>![alt text](content/images/a11yinactab.png "example of inaccessible data table") 
<br>Example of an inaccessible table, cells span multiple rows and columns

<br>Example of an accessible table, all rows/columns explicitly labelled
<br>

---
<!-- .slide: id="a11y" -->
## Accessible Design - Links and Buttons
- Links and Buttons: Must be descriptive (e.g. 'complete order' instead of 'click here')
- Must indicate the action of the link or button as part of the link or alt/title text (e.g. 'this will open in a new window') 

<br>![alt text](content/images/a11ylinkalt.png "example of accessible table")
<br>Example of an accessible link and button
<br>

---
<!-- .slide: id="a11y" -->
## Accessible Design - Modals and Pop-Up Windows
- Modals should be developed for information purposes and not have complex interactive elements.
- Pages with lengthy content should have clear markers indicating the scope of the content and provide the ability to jump to key points including the beginning and end

## Accessible Development

General Considerations
- Attempt to pin down client requirements for browsers to be supported before you start
  - Screen readers may behave differently with different browsers, which may require time to address
- Design and test accessibility includng unit testing from the start of a project instead of making it an add on later
- Familiarize yourself with JAWS and how other screen readers work.  Conduct a demo if required with your team
- Use syntactical scanning software (such as HiSoftware Compliance Sherriff) to help check for accessibility, but don't solely depend on them
- Use native HTML elements instead of developing custom controls
- Ensure HTML and CSS 'generated' by angular code enforces the following rules for accessibility


---
<!-- .slide: id="a11y" -->
## Accessible Development - Tabbing Order

- Ensure content is read top to bottom left to right.  Use `tabindex="-1"` for elements that need to be read by screen readers

For example - error handling where we want to bring the attention of a screen reader to the error message in the right order 

```
<div role="group" id="errorSummary" aria-labelledby="errorSummaryHeading" tabindex="-1">
  <h2 id="errorSummaryHeading">Your information contains three errors</h2>
    <ul>
      ...
    </ul>
</div>
```

---
<!-- .slide: id="a11y" -->
## Accessible Development - Tabbing Order (Continued)

- Use `tabindex=0` to include elements in the natural tab order of the content
  - It may be easier to include a native HTML element that is focusable by default rather than create a custom control

- Let the browser naturally handle tab order otherwise and do not use positive integers for `tabindex`, e.g. `tabindex="+1"` 

- Utilizing `tabindex="-1"` in conjunction with native elements to allow screen readers to follow the right read order

```
<ul role="menu" aria-hidden="true">								
  <li role="menuitem" tabindex="0">										
    <a href="a.com" title="go to a.com" tabindex="-1">a.com</a>											
  </li>									
  <li role="menuitem" tabindex="0">										
	  <a href="b.com" title="go to b.com" tabindex="-1">b.com</a>											
  </li>									
</ul>
```

## Accessible Development - Defining Page Sections

- Functionally divide the page up so that the user knows what section they are in with a screen reader
- There are several techniques for acheiving this (used in combination as required)
  - Use of `tabindex` as previously outlined
  - Additionally use of HTML elements to divide the page into functional sections
  - Use hidden navigation sections to allow for easy skipping of sections by screen readers
  - Use of text positioned off screen to provide readable content indicating what each of those sections are
- These will be examined in the following slides

---
<!-- .slide: id="a11y" -->
## Accessible Development - Defining Page Sections
### Dividing the Page

- Define the header, footer, and main sections of a page at a minimum
  - Header: `<header class="Header" role="banner" id="header" tabindex="0">`
  - Footer: `<footer id="footer" class="Footer" role="contentinfo" tabindex="0">`
  - Main: `<div id="content" class="wpthemeMainContent" role="main" tabindex="0" style="min-height: 587px;">`

---
<!-- .slide: id="a11y" -->
## Accessible Development - Defining Page Sections
###CSS for Navigation and Offscreen Text

- To help navigation for visually impaired users, develop offscreen-text and navigation related CSS classes to mark up page sections in a way hidden to visual users

```css
.offscreen-text {
  left: -3000px;
  position: absolute;
  width: 500px;
  font-size: 100%;}
```

```css
.SkipToNav {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
  font-size: .6em;
  padding-right: .375em;
}
```

---
<!-- .slide: id="a11y" -->
## Accessible Development - Defining Page Sections
###HTML for Offscreen Text and Navigation

- Add the HTML necessary to define navigation and offscreen text, marking sections for non-visual users and to allow easy skipping of sections
  - Screen readers like JAWS re-read all sections of a page upon page re-load, unless you give a user a mechanism for skipping sections

For example in your header div: 
```
	<nav class="SkipToNav" role="navigation">
		<h2 class="Offscreen-Text">Start of a.com skip to page section links</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="#content">Skip to content</a></li>
			<li><a href="#footer">Skip to footer</a></li>
			<li class="Hide"><a id="skipToErrorLink" href="#errors">Skip to errors</a></li>
		</ul>
	</nav>
```

<!-- .slide: id="a11y" -->
## Accessible Development - Tables

- Layout tables should be done using CSS and DIVS
  - Include ARIA roles to define table elements for screen readers
- If developing layout tables in HTML
  - Use the non-standard `datatable=0` attribute on the Table tags to tell JAWS to ignore layout tables
  - Don't use the `summary` attribute on the Table tag if you must create a layout table (or set the `summary` attribute to null
  - Don't use `<TH>` or Caption tags on layout tables
  - You can use `<TH>` and summary attributes for data tables and include the `scope="ROW"` or `scope="COL"` attributes to indicate what     the `<TH>` is for

## Accessible Development - Example CSS Layout Table

Example CSS for a layout table:
```css
<style>
div.container {
    width: 100%;
    border: 1px solid gray;
}
div.header {
    color: white;
    background-color: black;
}
div.main {
    color: black;
    background-color: white;
}
div.footer {
    color: white;
    background-color: black;
}
</style>
```

---
<!-- .slide: id="a11y" -->
## Accessible Development - Example HTML for Layout Table

Example HTML for a table:

```
<div class="container" role="table">
  <div class="header" role="rowgroup">
    <span>something</span>
  <div>
  <div class="main" role="rowgroup">
    <span><p>This is an example.</p></span>
  </div>
  <div class="footer">
    <span>Example Footer</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

---
<!-- .slide: id="a11y" -->
## Accessible Development - CSS - Fonts and Colour
- Use relative width and font sizing over absolutes where possible
  - `width: 50%;` 
  - `font-size: 1em;`, `font-size: 80%;`

- Use headers in sequnce (H1 - H6)


---
<!-- .slide: id="a11y" -->
## Accessible Development - Links and Buttons

- Add `title` attributes to links and `alt` text to images to provide accessible descriptions to them
- Use native HTML elements where possible instead of creating custom controls with ARIA roles attached

Example of an accessible link and button for navigation
```
<section class="Navigation"> 
  <div class="Buttons">
    <div class="Submit">
      <button class="buttonnav" type="submit" id="orderNowBtn" title="Click to order this product now">Order now</button>
    </div>
    <div class="Cancel">
      <a href="a.com/lastpage" title="Select back to go to the previous page">Back</a>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

---
<!-- .slide: id="a11y" -->
## Testing Accessibility - Approach

- Accessibility testing should typically start with manual testing and syntactical scanning, then be automated
- Manually: Test against a checklist of items as compared to WCAG 2.0 AA standards to ensure compliance
- Syntactically: Use Accessibility Developer Tools on [Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/accessibility-evaluation-toolb/), [HiSoftware Compliance Sheriff](https://www.cryptzone.com/products/compliance-sheriff), [Webaim Wave](wave.webaim.org/)
- Most importantly, end to end test using screen readers (Windows) and voiceover (Mac)!

- Then can automate tests with tools like Axecore

<!-- .slide: id="a11y" -->
## Testing Accessibility - Example #1

Upon inspection,the following inaccessible header line at the top of a form would have to be modified from:

```HTML
<h1 _ngcontent-cqy-0="">To Do</h1>
```

To:

```HTML
<header>
    <h1 class="offscreen-text">Start of header section of form</h1>
    <h1 _ngcontent-cqy-0="" tabindex="0">To Do</h1>
</header>
```

A `<main>` and `<footer>` section could then be added to the rest of the form as required

---
<!-- .slide: id="a11y" -->
## Testing Accessibility - Example #2

Upon inspection, the following inaccessible form input would have to be modified from:

```HTML
<p _ngcontent-cqy-2="">
    New Item: <input _ngcontent-cqy-2="" name="newItem" ngmodel="" required="" ng-reflect-name="newItem" class="ng-dirty ng-touched ng-invalid">
    <button _ngcontent-cqy-2="" type="submit" ng-reflect-disabled="true" disabled="">Add</button>
</p>
```

To:

```HTML
<p _ngcontent-cqy-2="" class="text">
    New Item: <input _ngcontent-cqy-2="" name="newItem" title="input a new item in alphanumeric format" ngmodel="" required="" ng-reflect-name="newItem" class="ng-dirty ng-touched ng-invalid">
    <button _ngcontent-cqy-2="" type="submit" ng-reflect-disabled="false" class="button" title="Select this button to add a new item to the list">Add</button>
</p>
```

---
<!-- .slide: id="a11y" -->
## Testing Accessibility - Example #3

Upon inspection, the following inaccessible error message section would have to be modified from:

```HTML
<ul _ngcontent-cqy-2="" class="errors">
    <li _ngcontent-cqy-2="">
    New item text is required
    </li>
</ul>
```

To:

```HTML
<div _ngcontent-cqy-2="" class="error"; tabindex="-1" aria-hidden="true" class="error">
    <span>Error:  Please enter item detail in alphanumeric format item</span>
</div>
```
