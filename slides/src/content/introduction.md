## What Is Angular

- Rendering Engline
  - Take an abstract idea like `TODO List` and put it on the screen
- It's made to scale:
  - Modules
  - Dependency Injection (that makes sense)
  - Typescript and tooling
  - Supporting projects: CLI, Universal, Nativescript
- A complete and opinionated solution
- You don't need to be a Javascript expert
